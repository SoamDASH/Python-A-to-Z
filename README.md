 # Section 1. Fundamentals

Syntax – introduce you to the basic Python programming syntax.

Variables – explain to you what variables are and how to create concise and meaningful variables.

Strings – learn about string data and some basic string operations.

Numbers – introduce to you the commonly-used number types including integers and floating-point numbers.

Booleans – explain the Boolean data type, false and truth values in Python.

Constants – show you how to define constants in Python.

Comments – learn how to make notes in your code.

Type conversion – learn how to convert a value of one type to another e.g., converting a string to a number.
Converting from string to integer:

number_str = "42"

number_int = int(number_str)
print(number_int)  # Output: 42

Converting from integer to string:

number_int = 42
number_str = str(number_int)
print(number_str)  # Output: "42"

Converting from string to float:

float_str = "3.14"
float_num = float(float_str)
print(float_num)  # Output: 3.14

Converting from float to integer:

float_num = 3.14
int_num = int(float_num)
print(int_num)  # Output: 3

Converting from list to string:

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
list_str = str(my_list)
print(list_str)  # Output: "[1, 2, 3]"

Converting from string to list:

list_str = "[1, 2, 3]"
my_list = eval(list_str)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

Note: We cant change string to integer



Input function - The input() function in Python is used to get input from the user. It displays a prompt message (optional) and waits for the user to enter a value. The value entered by the user is returned as a string.


name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

age = input("Enter your age: ")
print("You are " + age + " years old.")

Types of error:

SyntaxError:
This error occurs when there is a violation of the Python syntax rules.

NameError:
This error occurs when a variable or name is used before it is defined or declared.

TypeError:
This error occurs when an operation is performed on an object of an inappropriate type.

ValueError:
This error occurs when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.

# Section 2. Operators

Arithmetic Operators - used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, etc., on the given operands.
